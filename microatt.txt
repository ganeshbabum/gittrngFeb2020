Other than desgin changes.... Functionality wise... Do we have any major difference between Microservices and our traditional web api services using .net core or 
Net framework?

Security wise..... What r the major differences we can understand here?

But this Microservices requires more resources which eventually increase the cost of development right

Load balancing we do at server side I mean on cloud environment or even we need to configure or make something ready at developer point in his development
Or else is everything automated without much developer role ?

Karthik Babu V to Organizer(s)

what does amenable mean with respect to microservices?
Reply in private



11:15

Pavankumar Cherukuri to me

Yes it's bit amenable. 
We can have a full advantage ( control ) over the services that we r developing, so if anything causing an issue developer takes privilege to look into it. And there is a chance to fix in optimistic time if there is better understanding of the problem and if we have a troubleshoot answer.

How Microservices performance impacts if we r using suppose database server an SQL server type and to that of document based databases ( like no SQL ) like mongodb..... Which is faster and efficient and best approach
